Final Bitsy project for GAME-110.

Bit Fiction
I'm recreating the scene from Pulp Fiction where Vincent revives Mia with a direct shot of adrenaline to the heart.

I'm thinking it can be a simple fetch-quest sort of deal. In the original, a lot of the prep for the injection is done by other characters, but in the Bitsy game, I may have you as Vincent be the one to get the marker, adrenaline, etc. This also makes it easier to adapt, as I won't have to deal with other characters moving around.
Walkthrough:
1. Get into the house and be told what to do.
2. Go look for and get the marker to note where Mia's heart would be.
3. Get the Adrenaline from Lance.
4. Do the injection as featured in the movie.
   (Obviously, the dialogue will make the experience a lot longer than it sounds, as that is where most of the tension is.
